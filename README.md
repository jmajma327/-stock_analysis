VBA Challenge
Purpose:
The purpose of this analysis was to look at stocks from 2017 to 2018 so that Steveâ€™s can choose the right stocks for his parents.
Results
I created a worksheet in excel labeled green stock to help assist Steve in finding the right stocks for his parents. In this workbook I used some VBA macro codes to go through all the data. This worksheet had minimized the data so he could view. While desegregating the data this code took a bit of time specifically 1.140625 s for 2017 and .8867188s in 2018.
