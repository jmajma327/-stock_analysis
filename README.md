VBA Challenge

Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to look at stocks from 2017 to 2018 so that Steveâ€™s can choose the right stocks for his parents.

Results

I created a worksheet in excel labeled green stock to help assist Steve in finding the right stocks for his parents. In this workbook I used some VBA macro codes to go through all the data. This worksheet had minimized the data so he could view. While desegregating the data this code took a bit of time specifically 1.140625 s for 2017 and .8867188s in 2018.

I refactored the data to make the worksheet more efficient. After refactoring the code, it made a difference the time the code desecrating the data to .515625 s for 2017 and .40625s for 2018. Steve and his parents now have all the information to make conscious and effective decisions on which stocks to purchase. 



Steve should recommend that his parents invest in the ENPH and RUN stocks because they are the only two stocks listed that had a positive return in both 2017 and 2018. 






Summary
What are the advantages or disadvantages or refactoring code?
The advantages of refactoring the code is that it makes it more efficient to gather information for your analysis.  It also runs the code in faster time because of the variables that were removed or commented throughout the code.
A disadvantage to refactoring the code is that it is time consuming and could affect your ability to complete the task for the client.
